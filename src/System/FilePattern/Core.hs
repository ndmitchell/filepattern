-- | A type synonym for file patterns, containing @**@ and @*@. For the syntax
--   and semantics of 'FilePattern' see 'System.FilePattern.?=='.
--
--   Most 'FilePath' values lacking literal @.@ and @..@ components are suitable as 'FilePattern' values which match
--   only that specific file. On Windows @\\@ is treated as equivalent to @\/@.
--
--   You can write 'FilePattern' values as a literal string, or build them
--   up using the operators '<.>' and '</>' (but be aware that @\"\" '</>' \"foo\"@ produces @\"./foo\"@).

-- [Note: Split on ""]
--
-- For parsing patterns and paths, "" can either be [] or [""].
-- Assuming they are consistent, the only cases that are relevant are:
--
-- > match "" "" = Just []
-- > match "*" "" = if [] then Nothing else Just [""]
-- > match "**" "" = if [] then Just [] else Just [""]
--
-- We pick "" splits as [""] because that is slightly more permissive,
-- follows the builtin semantics of split, and matches the 'filepath'
-- library slightly better.

parsePath :: FilePath -> Path

        f :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Wildcard [a]
        f x xs = case split (== x) xs of
            pre:mid_post -> case unsnoc mid_post of

-- [Note: Conversion of parts to String]
--
-- The match of * is String, but the match for ** is really [String].
-- To simplify the API, since everything else is String encoding [String],
-- we want to convert that [String] to String. We considered 3 solutions.
--
-- 1) Since we know the elements of [String] don't contain /, a natural
-- solution is to insert / characters between items with intercalate, but that
-- doesn't work because [] and [""] end up with the same representation, but
-- are very different, e.g.
--
-- > match "**/a" "a"  = Just []
-- > match "**/a" "/a" = Just [""]
--
-- 2) We can join with "/" after every component, so ["a","b"] becomes
-- "a/b/". But that causes / characters to appear from nowhere, e.g.
--
-- > match "**" "a" = Just ["a/"]
--
-- 3) Logically, the only sensible encoding for [] must be "". Because [""]
-- can't be "" (would clash), it must be "/". Therefore we follow solution 2 normally,
-- but switch to solution 1 iff all the components are empty.
-- We implement this scheme with mkParts/fromParts.
--
-- Even after all that, we still have weird corner cases like:
--
-- > match "**" "/" = Just ["//"]
--
-- But the only realistic path it applies to is /, which should be pretty rare.
