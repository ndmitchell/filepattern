{- | Efficient matching of a set of 'FilePattern's against a set of 'FilePath's.
  First call 'step' passing in all the 'FilePattern's, with a tag for each one.
  Next call the methods of 'Step', providing the components of the 'FilePath's in turn.

  Useful for efficient bulk searching, particularly directory scanning, where you can
  avoid descending into directories which cannot match.
